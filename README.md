He pursued B.S. & M.S. in Physics from IIT Madras, and got interested in Programming and
Free & Open Source Software when creating simulations for toy physics models. After
graduation, he lucked into a Scientific Software Developer role at Enthought, where he built
software to solve Scientific and Engineering problems. While at Enthought, he got to work from
Pune, India, Chennai, India, Austin, Texas, USA, and Cambridge, UK over the course of eight
interesting years. He started contributing to FOSS projects in the Scientific Python ecosystem

He started volunteering with the FOSS United Foundation afterwards, speaking at various FOSS United
events, helping organize IndiaFOSS 2023, and organizing HydFOSS 2023. He eventually joined
FOSS United full-time in May 2024 and has been with the Foundation ever since.

He loves to teach and has given talks and workshops on various topics like Python Programming,
FOSS, FOSS Policy, and Tech Policy in general.

His wife, Dr. Preeti Saryan, co-founded the Saryan Vigyan Foundation. He and his wife argue
about two things - how to run an organization and how to raise their son, Luffy.

### Long intro

Rahul is the CEO of the [FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org), the Head of Software at [Softcircuits Labs](http://softcircuits.in/),
and an Advisor to the [Saryan Vigyan Foundation](https://www.saryanfoundation.org/).

He pursued [B.S. & M.S. in Physics](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/academics/dualdegreeprogrambs&ms.html)
from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), and got interested in Programming and
Free & Open Source Software when creating simulations for toy physics models. After
graduation, he lucked into a Scientific Software Developer role at [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/), where he built
software to solve Scientific and Engineering problems. While at Enthought, he got to work from
Pune, India, Chennai, India, Austin, Texas, USA, and Cambridge, UK over eight
interesting years. He started contributing to FOSS projects in the Scientific Python ecosystem
while at Enthought, eventually becoming a [maintainer](https://pypi.org/user/rporuri/) for a few [FOSS projects created at Enthought](https://github.com/enthought).

He got lucky again when [he received a Scholarship](https://forum.fossunited.org/t/technology-policy-course-scholarship-for-foss-devs/1220/6?u=rahulporuri)
from the [FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org) to pursue the
[Graduate Certificate in Public Policy (Tech & Policy) course](https://school.takshashila.org.in/gcpp-technology-policy) by the [Takshashila Institution](https://takshashila.org.in/).
He started volunteering with the FOSS United Foundation afterwards, speaking at various FOSS United
events, helping organize [IndiaFOSS 2023](https://indiafoss.net/2023), and organizing [HydFOSS 2023](https://indiafoss.net/Hyderabad/2023).
He eventually joined FOSS United [full-time in May 2024](https://fossunited.org/blog/organization/meet-the-ceo-of-foss-united-foundation)
and has been with the Foundation ever since.

He loves to teach and has given [talks and workshops](https://github.com/rahulporuri/talks)
on various topics like Python Programming, FOSS, FOSS Policy, and Tech Policy in general.

His wife, [Dr. Preeti Saryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-preeti-saryan-92574438/),
co-founded the [Saryan Vigyan Foundation](https://www.saryanfoundation.org/). He and his wife argue
about two things - how to run an organization and how to raise their son, Luffy.
